# Low-cost-Potentiometer-using-Arduino
Smart wireless potentiometer specially design for measure the chemical potentials.


Potentiometry is one of the most useful electroanalytical techniques which has a wide range of industrial applications. Also, potentiometers are frequently used in physical and analytical chemistry practicals. However, the cost of electrodes and potentiometer devices limits its usage of this instrument in practical laboratories. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a potentiometer using the Arduino Uno board coded by C language. Another intended advantage of this instrument is all the potential measurements are directly fed to the Android mobile application through a Blue-tooth connection and perform the necessary calculations. The development process of Low-Cost potentiometer was done according to the design of an electronic circuit for the potentiometer, calibration of the voltage sensor and AD620 instrumental amplifier, implement source code for Arduino potentiometer and design and implement android application. High accuracy with four decimal points and very much closer readings were obtained by using the new device compared with respect to the laboratory potentiometer. Finally, as obtained results students were able to use Low-cost potentiometer for the potentiometric titrations without any issues.
